Ok folks, this is the d2x port of descent 2.
At this stage most of descent 2 works under linux:

Known bugs/unintentional features/missing stuff:
* Serial support doesn't work. (UDP and IPX networking does)
* Movies (unlikely ever to be supported)
* Sound glitches (due to stuff I haven't implemented)
* The mouse support is at the same level as it was in d1x (as in, it kind of works)
* Something went screwy with the control config system, it kinda got "d1xed"...
* OpenGL leaks memory like it is going out of fashion. It leaked about 64meg in a few minutes for me. I need to debug this =)

Basically, to compile this under linux:
You need the SDL 1.0 or greater, and a thread-safe X server.
Do a ./autogen.sh then a make. Cross your fingers and pray, it worked on my machine.

For OpenGL support, try building with --with-opengl. Your mileage may vary (but basically, you need an accelerated Mesa sitting somewhere where I can see it)... The OpenGL support isn't perfect, but it works...

There are two ways to report bugs and give feedback:
1) Get on the descent-source mailing list by sending an email to majordomo@warpcore.org with the body as: "subscribe descent-source <your email address>". Discussions about the source code in general are available here, and is the main list that d2x and d1x, a similar project for descent 1 is discussed on. Patches and questions can be posted there, as well.

2) Send feedback directly to me, peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au. I'll try to get back to you ASAP, depending on real-life concerns =)

Message from Matt Toschlog & Mike Kulas:

Descent fans:

Here, finally, is the source for Descent II.  We've been so busy with 
Descent 3, Mercenary, FreeSpace, FreeSpace 2, and several other 
projects that we haven't given much thought to this old code.  But we 
know that many of you are eager to get it, so here you go.

We were amazed and impressed at the cool things people did with 
the Descent source we released a few years ago.  It touches us 
deeply how devoted some people are to the Descent series, and we 
look forward to seeing what people can do with this Descent II 
source.

About the Source Code:

Included is almost all the source code to Descent 2, ver. 1.2.  We removed
all code to which we did not own the copyright.  This mainly involved low-
level sound and modem code and the movie code.    

The Descent Network has agreed to provide a list of mirror locations where 
this code can be downloaded. The location is:

http://www.descent2.com/ddn/sources/descent2

The following tools were used in the development of Descent:
Watcom C/C++, version 9.5
Microsoft Macro Assembler, version 6.1x
Opus Make, version 6.01

Have fun with the code!

As Packaged the code currently will not compile. Some code had to be removed
to release it, therefore you will get some missing file errors when building.

Much of this code is very close to the Descent 1 source code. Many people have
put effort into porting that code, so if you are interested in porting D2, you
should be able to take advantage of some of that work.
