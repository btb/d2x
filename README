D2X
===========

http://icculus.org/d2x

Linux:
======

Required tools:
* GCC 2.95
* SDL 1.1.0 or higher
  (get it from http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/SDL/)
* NASM 0.98 (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED, not sure, try your linux distribution)
* A thread safe X server.
* Make, sed, etc...


Build instructions:
Install all of the components above. Next, from the d2x directory:

./configure
	./configure --help will show you the available options.
	If you have a 3d graphics card, use --with-opengl

make
make install

see installation.txt for info on where to put your datafiles, etc.


Known bugs/issues:
* Serial support doesn't work. (UDP and IPX networking does)
* Sound glitches (due to stuff I haven't implemented)
* The mouse support is at the same level as it was in d1x (as in, it
  kind of works)


MS-DOS:
=======

Dos support isn't a high priority right now, so things may be a little
messed up.

Required tools:
* DJGPP v2
The following DJGPP packages are ALL REQUIRED (newer versions are ok)!
v2/
djdev203.zip
v2gnu/
bnu281b.zip gcc2952b.zip mak3781b.zip bsh1147b.zip sed302b.zip
m4-14b.zip acnf213b.zip gwk304b.zip txt20b.zip grep22b.zip dif272b.zip
So many packages are needed to support the autoconf build system that d2x
uses. (Sorry! =)
* NASM v0.98 or better is REQUIRED


Build instructions:
Install all of the djgpp packages above. Make sure that DJGPP is properly
configure (see the DJGPP docs for more information).
Make a copy of bash.exe in your djgpp bin/ directory. Call it "sh.exe". This
step is VERY IMPORTANT (otherwise all the scripts will fail).

Now, run the following from the d2x directory:
djgpp.bat
make

Hopefully things will work out and the package will build correctly for you.

Known bugs/issues:
* Serial and network support missing.
* Sound support missing.



Reporting bugs/feedback:
========================

There are two ways to report bugs and give feedback:
1) Get on the descent-source mailing list by sending an email to
majordomo@warpcore.org with the body as: "subscribe descent-source
<your email address>". Discussions about the source code in general
are available here, and is the main list that d2x and d1x, a similar
project for descent 1 is discussed on. Patches and questions can be
posted there, as well.

2) Send feedback directly to me, bradleyb@u.washington.edu. I'll try
to get back to you ASAP, depending on real-life concerns =)

Message from Matt Toschlog & Mike Kulas:

Descent fans:

Here, finally, is the source for Descent II.  We've been so busy with 
Descent 3, Mercenary, FreeSpace, FreeSpace 2, and several other 
projects that we haven't given much thought to this old code.  But we 
know that many of you are eager to get it, so here you go.

We were amazed and impressed at the cool things people did with 
the Descent source we released a few years ago.  It touches us 
deeply how devoted some people are to the Descent series, and we 
look forward to seeing what people can do with this Descent II 
source.

About the Source Code:

Included is almost all the source code to Descent 2, ver. 1.2.  We removed
all code to which we did not own the copyright.  This mainly involved low-
level sound and modem code and the movie code.    

The Descent Network has agreed to provide a list of mirror locations where 
this code can be downloaded. The location is:

http://www.descent2.com/ddn/sources/descent2

The following tools were used in the development of Descent:
Watcom C/C++, version 9.5
Microsoft Macro Assembler, version 6.1x
Opus Make, version 6.01

Have fun with the code!

As Packaged the code currently will not compile. Some code had to be removed
to release it, therefore you will get some missing file errors when building.

Much of this code is very close to the Descent 1 source code. Many people have
put effort into porting that code, so if you are interested in porting D2, you
should be able to take advantage of some of that work.
