--- Version 0.1.4 ---
- mve support :-)
- Lots of portability fixes
- OS X support!
- Other bigendian linux/unix support?
- Shareware data files support!

--- Version 0.1.3 ---
- deb and rpm support added
- Added hotkeys to toggle fullscreen mode (same as d1x)
- joystick (via SDL) works
- fixed bug preventing some high-res modes in SDL
- disabled cockpit in ogl modes (causes crashes)
- automap resolution selectable with -automap<X>x<Y> or -automap_gameres

--- Version 0.1.2 ---
- SDL uses mouse wheel to emulate 3rd axis.
- Player files created with descent 2 should now work with d2x.
- Savegame thumbnails work in OpenGL
- Menus now work in OpenGL!
- Automap works in OpenGL!
- Fonts work in OpenGL!
- You can now use the -tmap option to select between the different
  texture mapping routines (c, fp, i386, pent, ppro) at runtime.
- Please bear with me while the source undergoes some rather ugly
  reorganization to fit more closely to the layout of d1x. This makes
  synchronization with d1x far, far easier.
- Fixed assembly bug causing crash on game start.  Thanks to Craig
  Hadady <chadady@iglou.com>
- Applied chdir patch from Falk Hueffner
  <falk.hueffner@student.uni-tuebingen.de>, and added code to load
  hogfiles from a central location, so it now doesn't matter what dir
  you start d2x from.
- Enabled option for RELEASE build
- ggi builds again (still broken, though)

--- Version 0.1.1 ---
Assembly under mingw32 now works.
Invulnerable robots bug fixed!
Build process much faster.
network support now compiles on mingw, dunno if it works...

--- Version 0.1.0 ---
Builds with SDL/OpenGL, even on Windows (MingW32)
Lots of minor changes and cleanups of the build system.

--- Version 0.0.9 ---
Improved automake setup, 'make dist' and VPATH builds now work.
svgalib, ggi support (alpha)
Merged in joystick support from Michael.Wagener@materna.de
Added -grabmouse option to keep the mouse from wandering away in
windowed SDL.  Pressing pause ungrabs it.

--- Version 0.0.8 ---
Added -nocdrom option, fixed cdrom code.
Made various error messages more helpful.
Big code cleanup - removed lots and lots of warnings. Still plenty left, but most are gone.
Kludge to allow the game to work with v1.0 datafiles.
Workaround for odd gcc bug (possible).
Fixed mission and demo loading.
Fixed nonetwork build.
Removed libtool dependancy. (Thanks to Falk Hueffner for pointing this out)

--- Version 0.0.7 ---
Added beginnings of console. (main/console.c main/cmd.c)
Added -debug command line option to show debug information.
Fixed -nosound option.
Changed malloc, calloc, free -> d_malloc, d_calloc and d_free to prevent ugly clashes between the real and the wrapped system calls. Added d_strdup
Removed dos linefeeds from the source files
Fixed palette problems with flat shaded polygons.

Issues currently under investigation:
* Weird crash reported by Robert Linden - as yet unreproducable

--- Version 0.0.6 ---
