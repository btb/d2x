In addition to d2x, you need some data files to play.  On un*x, these
files need to go into a shared data directory
(/usr/local/share/games/d2x by default).  On Windows or DOS, they go
in the same directory as the d2x binary.

Base Installation
-----------------

The base install depends on which version of the datafiles you have.
d2x currently supports just about any version of Descent II, and can
use almost any version of Descent I as an add-on.

Place these files into your shared data dir:

Full Version (PC or Mac):
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
alien1.pig
alien2.pig
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

If you want movies, place the .mvl files in your shared data dir:
intro-h.mvl and/or intro-l.mvl
other-h.mvl and/or other-l.mvl
robots-h.mvl and/or robots-l.mvl
The mvl files from the Mac version will not work.  They are in a
different format!

OEM Version (Destination: Quartzon):
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

If you want movies, place the .mvl files in your shared data dir:
intro-l.mvl
other-l.mvl
robots-h.mvl and/or robots-l.mvl

PC Shareware:
d2demo.ham
d2demo.hog
d2demo.pig

Mac Shareware:
d2demo.ham
d2demo.hog
d2demo.pig
descent2.s11
exit.ham
d2.mn2


Mission Installation
--------------------

d2x should be able to play any missions for Descent I or Descent II,
including the original Descent I mission (Descent: First Strike)

In order to play any add-on missions, you need to have a full set of
textures.  That is, your base installation above must be the "Full
Version", the "OEM Version", or the "Mac Shareware" version.

To install an additional mission, just place the .hog and the .msn or
.mn2 file into your missions directory.  The missions directory can be
inside the system-wide data dir, or your $HOME/.d2x dir.  d2x will
look in both places.

To install the original Descent I mission:
Place descent.hog into your data dir.

d2x tries to make Descent I levels look as close to the original as
possible, using just Descent II textures from. However, if d2x finds
a .pig file from Descent I (except PC shareware and 1.0 versions)
installed in the data dir, it is able to improve the originality
by reading textures from there (except for animated textures).


Vertigo Installation
--------------------

Vertigo consists of both netgame enhancements (codenamed HOARD) and an
additional mission.  To install HOARD, place hoard.ham in your data
dir.  To play the vertigo mission, place d2x.hog and d2x.mn2 in your
mission dir.
If you want the movies that go with the vertigo mission, place
d2x-h.mvl and/or d2x-l.mvl in your data dir.


Notes
-----

In unix, all filenames must be in _lower case_. It's important.

It is not necessary to run the D2 setup program to extract the files
you need, just use unarj to extract the files from descent2.sow on the
cd.

If you use the mac demo data files, and they are not auto-detected
(colors come out wrong), use the -macdata switch.

If your computer has performance problems playing the movies, you can
tell it to play the low resolution versions by setting MovieHires=0 in
your descent.cfg file.
You can also override this setting by passing the -lowresmovies switch
or by deleting all *-h.mvl files.
