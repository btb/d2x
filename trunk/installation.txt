In addition to d2x, you need some data files to play.  On un*x, these
files need to go into a shared data directory
(/usr/local/share/games/d2x by default).  On Windows or DOS, they go
in the same directory as the d2x binary.

To Play the Descent 2 demo:
Place these files into your shared data dir:
d2demo.ham
d2demo.hog
d2demo.pig
d2demo.mn2 (distributed with d2x)

To Play Descent 2 registered:
Place these files into your shared data dir:
alien1.pig
alien2.pig
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

To play Descent 1 registered:
All the files from Descent 2 registered, plus:
Place these files into the missions subdir of your shared data dir:
descent.hog
descent.msn (distributed with d2x)

Note the filenames must be in _lower case_. It's important.

Note also that you don't have to run the D2 setup program to extract
the files, just unarj descent2.sow from the cd.
