In addition to d2x, you need some data files to play.  On un*x, these
files need to go into a shared data directory
(/usr/local/share/games/d2x by default).  On Windows or DOS, they go
in the same directory as the d2x binary.

Base Installation
-----------------

The base install depends on which version of the datafiles you have.
d2x currently supports the full version, the OEM version (Destination:
Quartzon), the PC shareware version, and the Mac shareware version.
Place these files into your shared data dir:

Full Version:
alien1.pig
alien2.pig
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

OEM Version:
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

PC Shareware:
d2demo.ham
d2demo.hog
d2demo.pig

Mac Shareware:
d2demo.ham
d2demo.hog
d2demo.pig
descent2.s11
exit.ham
d2.mn2

Mission Installation
--------------------

d2x should be able to play any missions for Descent 1 or Descent 2,
including the original Descent 1 mission (Descent: First Strike)

In order to play any add-on missions, you need to have a full set of
textures.  That is, your base installation above must be the "Full
Version", the "OEM Version", or the "Mac Shareware" version.

To install an additional mission, just place the .hog and the .msn or
.mn2 file into your missions directory.  The missions directory can be
inside the system-wide data dir, or your $HOME/.d2x dir.  d2x will
look in both places.

To install the original Descent 1 mission:
Place descent.hog into your data dir.


Vertigo Installation
--------------------

Vertigo consists of both game enhancements (codenamed HOARD) and an
additional mission.  To install HOARD, place hoard.ham in your data
dir.  To play the vertigo mission, place d2x.hog and d2x.mn2 in your
mission dir.


Notes
-----

In unix, the filenames must be in _lower case_. It's important.

It is not necessary to run the D2 setup program to extract the files
you need, just use unarj to extract the files from descent2.sow on the
cd.

If you use the mac data files, and they are not auto-detected (colors
come out wrong), use the -macdata switch.
