Firstly, compile d2x.

Then stick it in a directory with these files from Descent 2
Registered (the version _does not_ matter).  Shareware may work 
eventually, but the datafiles are of a differnt format.

I needed these files: (in addition to the d2x binary)
alien1.pig
alien2.pig
descent2.ham
descent2.hog
descent2.s11
descent2.s22
fire.pig
groupa.pig
ice.pig
water.pig

Note the filenames must be in _lower case_. It's important.

Note that you don't have to run the D2 setup program to extract the
files, just unarj descent2.sow from the cd.
