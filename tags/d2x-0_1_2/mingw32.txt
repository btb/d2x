Instructions for building D2X for MinGW32
-----------------------------------------

Using Cygwin
------------
First you will need SDL.
Download the source code tarball from http://www.libsdl.org/
Currently, it is SDL-1.2.3.tar.gz.

tar zxf SDL-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd SDL-1.2.3
./configure
make
make install

Note that SDL.dll needs to be in your executable PATH, since that is
where windows looks for dlls.
I recommend copying it to /usr/local/bin:
cp /usr/local/lib/SDL.dll /usr/local/bin

If you need to run autogen.sh (e.g. to rebuild the configure scripts,
or to build from cvs) sdl.m4 will have to be somewhere where aclocal
can find it.
You can fix this by setting the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable like this:
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=/usr/local/share/aclocal

You should also install NASM, for compiling assembler files.  Download
it from http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/where.html and place nasmw.exe
somewhere in your path (e.g. /usr/local/bin):
unzip nasm-0.98-win32.zip
mv nasmw.exe /usr/local/bin

Now you can configure d2x as normal.  i.e. 
./configure
or
./configure --with-opengl

automake/autoconf in cygwin has a problem with not always putting the
.exe extentions where they need to be.  So you may have to run make
twice, like so:
make && make d2x-sdl.exe
or
make && make d2x-ogl.exe
