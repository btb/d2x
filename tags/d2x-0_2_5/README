Linux/Unix:
===========

Required tools:
* GCC 2.95 or higher
* SDL 1.1.0 or higher
* NASM 0.98 (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED for x86)
* A thread safe X server.
* GNU make is probably required as well.

Build instructions:
Install all of the components above. Next, from the d2x directory:

./configure
	./configure --help will show you the available options.
	If you have a 3d graphics card, use --with-opengl

VPATH builds also work (i.e., you can put the source in one directory
and build in another.  Just execute the configure script from the
build directory like so:
mkdir d2x-build
cd d2x-build
../d2x-source/configure

make
make install

on systems where `make' isn't GNU make, use `gmake' instead.

see installation.txt for info on where to put your datafiles, etc.

Known bugs/issues:

* Serial support doesn't work. (UDP and IPX networking does)
* Sound glitches (due to stuff I haven't implemented)
* The mouse support is at the same level as it was in d1x (as in, it
  kind of works) (btb: works pretty good for me.)


Win32:
======

Required tools:
* Cygwin
  d2x doesn't use Cygwin, but it makes building it easier (to me).
  You can probably build it with just MinGW, but I haven't tried yet.
* SDL 1.1.0 or higher
* NASM 0.98 (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)

Note that SDL.dll needs to be in your executable PATH, since that is
where windows looks for dlls.
I recommend copying or moving it to /usr/local/bin:
cp /usr/local/lib/SDL.dll /usr/local/bin

If you need to run autogen.sh (e.g. to rebuild the configure scripts,
or to build from cvs) sdl.m4 will have to be somewhere where aclocal
can find it.
You can fix this by setting the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable like this:
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=/usr/local/share/aclocal

Now you can configure d2x as normal.  i.e.
./configure
or
./configure --with-opengl

automake/autoconf in cygwin has a problem with not always putting the
.exe extentions where they need to be.  So you may have to run make
twice, like so:
make && make d2x-sdl.exe
or
make && make d2x-gl.exe

Then just copy your executable and SDL.dll into the descent2 directory.


MS-DOS:
=======

Dos support isn't a high priority right now, so things may be a little
messed up.

Required tools:
* DJGPP v2
The following DJGPP packages are ALL REQUIRED (newer versions are ok)!
v2/
djdev203.zip
v2gnu/
bnu281b.zip gcc2952b.zip mak3781b.zip bsh1147b.zip sed302b.zip
m4-14b.zip acnf213b.zip gwk304b.zip txt20b.zip grep22b.zip dif272b.zip
So many packages are needed to support the autoconf build system that d2x
uses. (Sorry! =)
* NASM v0.98 or better is REQUIRED


Build instructions:
Install all of the djgpp packages above. Make sure that DJGPP is properly
configure (see the DJGPP docs for more information).
Make a copy of bash.exe in your djgpp bin/ directory. Call it "sh.exe". This
step is VERY IMPORTANT (otherwise all the scripts will fail).

Now, run the following from the d2x directory:
djgpp.bat
make

Hopefully things will work out and the package will build correctly for you.

Known bugs/issues:
* Serial and network support missing.
* Sound support missing.


MAC OS X
========

Install the latest version of apple's developer tools.
Compile and install SDL from source: d2x doesn't use Project Builder.

configure and compile as with other unices.

Known bugs/issues:
* Serial and network support missing
* GL version very buggy


Bugs/feedback:
==============

There are three places to report bugs and give feedback:

You can get on the descent-source mailing list by sending an email to
majordomo@warpcore.org with the body as: "subscribe descent-source
<your email address>". Discussions about the source code in general
are available here, and is the main list that d2x and d1x, a similar
project for descent 1, are discussed on. Patches and questions can be
posted there, as well.

Use Bugzilla. https://bugzilla.icculus.org/

Contact me directly, btb@icculus.org.  I'll try to get back to you
ASAP, depending on real-life concerns =)
