Instructions for building D2X for MinGW32
-----------------------------------------

Using Cygwin
------------
First you will need SDL.  Download the development libraries for
Win32/mingw32 from http://www.libsdl.org/ Currently, it is
SDL-devel-1.2.2-mingw32.tar.gz.  Inside this file, you will find
another tar.gz, called i386-mingw32msvc.tar.gz.  This should be
untarred under /usr/local/cross-tools:
mkdir /usr/local/cross-tools
cd /usr/local/cross-tools
tar zxf /path/to/i386-mingw32msvc.tar.gz

Then you should place SDL.dll and sdl-config somewhere in your PATH.
I recommend /usr/local/bin:
cp /usr/local/cross-tools/i386-mingw32msvc/lib/SDL.dll /usr/local/bin
cp /usr/local/cross-tools/i386-mingw32msvc/bin/sdl-config /usr/local/bin

If you need to run autogen.sh (e.g. to rebuild the configure scripts,
or to build from cvs) you have to have the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable set.
for example:
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=/usr/local/cross-tools/i386-mingw32msvc/share/aclocal

You should also install NASM, for compiling assembler files.  Download
it from http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/where.html and place nasmw.exe
somewhere in your path (e.g. /usr/local/bin):
unzip nasm-0.98-win32.zip
mv nasmw.exe /usr/local/bin

Now you can configure and build d2x as normal.
